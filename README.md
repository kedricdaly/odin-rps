# How to play
This game is completely played in the developer console.
This can often be opend with Ctrl + Shift + I on Windows or Cmd + Shift + I on MacOS.

Once in the console, run the function "game()" to play a best-of-5 round game.

There is currently no error-checking for bad inputs to the game and a bad input results in a tie for that round.
